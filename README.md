- 👋 Hi, I’m @erichardson2626 (Evan Richardson). I'm 30 years old with Bachelors Degree in Chemistry.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Swift, Ethical Hacking, and Math in general.
- 🌙 I became interested in computers when I turned 29. My first project was to use XCode to build an iPhone app for my laboratory.
- 📲 The Lab App is my only complete project, and can be found here [Phase Separation Science App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pssi/id6499057790)
- 🌱 Once I finished and released the app, I decided to pursue a burp suite certification. This is my current task as of today.
- 🎸 I casually play Bass Guitar.
- 🧩 I play a lot of online chess.
- 📫 You can reach me at erichardson262673@gmail.com
